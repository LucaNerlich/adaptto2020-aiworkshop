1.) Data Science in AEM using Python with AEMpy
------

**Description**: The objective is to install a python environment to get familiar with the AEM python library: AEMpy

This procedure has been successfully tested on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

**Please make sure you have been through the prerequisites before running the code.**

**For the prerequisites, see the file 0.Prerequisites.md**

1. Start Python by typing in your terminal:
```
$ python
```

2. Once in the python interpreter:
```
# Import AEMpy library
import aempy
```

3. Connect and display the AEM version
```
# Connect to the AEM Instance
instance = aempy.AEM()
```
```
# Get the product information
productinfo = instance.info()
```
```
# Print the product version
print(productinfo.version)
```

4. Get the error logs
```
# Connect to the system console
system = aempy.System()
```
```
# Get the five first lines of the error.log file
errorlogs = system.log_error(5)
```
```
# Print the lines
print(errorlogs)
```

5. Parse the logs
```
# Let's get more line from error.log (default: 10.000 lines)
errorlogs = system.log_error()
```
We import a new library named **pandas** (it has nothing to do with the animal).
Pandas is a Data analysis and manipulation library, mainly using a data frame.
```
# Import Pandas library
import pandas as pd
```
 *Note: It is a good practice to have all the imports at the beginning of your python program. But for the comprehension of this tutorial, we added it here.*
```
# Split the logs and arrange in a table using the Pandas library
dfLog = pd.DataFrame([sub.split(" ") for sub in errorlogs])
```
```
# Add Names to the columns
dfLog = dfLog.rename(columns={0:'date',1:'time',2:'level',3:'ID',4:'class',5:'msg'})
```
```
# Print the parsed logs
`print(dfLog)`
```

6. Convert logs to a pandas Dataframe
```
# There is a builtin parsing in AEMpy to automatically convert logs to pandas data frame
dfErrors = system.log_to_pandas(errorlogs)
```
```
# Print the first 10 lines of the pandas dataframe
print(dfErrors.head())
```
```
# Ask pandas to describe the dataframe
print(dfErrors.describe())
```

7. Analyze the logs with the *ERROR* level
```
# Filter the logs by level
dfLevelError = dfErrors[dfErrors["level"].str.match("ERROR")]
# Add a title for the next actions
print("Information about log errors:")
```
```
# Display the first 5 lines of the dataframe
print(dfLevelError.head())
```
```
# Display the last 5 lines of the dataframe
print(dfLevelError.tail())
```
```
# Describe the table
print(dfLevelError.describe())
```
At this point, we have analyzed the error logs using a raw solution (without pandas) and parsed solution (with pandas) that gives us the possibility to do more in-depth analysis.
There are two problems with the python interpreter:
 - Once you have quit the interpreter, all your context is lost
 - You can not plot graph, which helps a lot to understand your data
