Artificial intelligence is redefining fields, including digital asset management (DAM), by automating cumbersome tasks and improving productivity and time to market. AI is generating new, valuable insights for marketers and content managers, helping them optimize  experiences at scale and deliver greater ROI.

Adobe’s content intelligence beta services are now available for  Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), with the creation of a robust extensibility framework which allows the application of AI precisely where it’s needed in the asset workflows. Done right, AI can be transformational — but the key is to get the packaging and features of AI spot-on so that it can best augment the effectiveness of your marketer and customers.

In this workshop, learn about:

Adobe Sensei AI capabilities in DAM workflows, such as metadata management, search
Content and Commerce AI Beta services for AEM CS
Best practices for using AI in DAM
Data Science in AEM using Python with AEMpy
Building Data Science Reports using AEM data and Jupyter Notebook
Project Firefly Intro
